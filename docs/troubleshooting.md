## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong.  This guide is aimed at making them right.  It has two sections:

   * [Troubleshooting your application](/docs/user-guide/application-troubleshooting) - Useful for users who are deploying applications based around IFC and wondering why it is not working.
   * [Troubleshooting your something](/docs/admin/cluster-troubleshooting) - Useful for people using IFC for something else.
