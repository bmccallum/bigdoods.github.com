title: What is IFC?
---

IFC is the name given to Industry foundation classes. Each class represents a building object and a web of dependencies along with other characteristics that it inherits from the EXPRESS data modelling language.

The EXPRESS data modelling language is a part of the sc4(iso organisation) project to create a method to exchange data related to manufacturing and production and is closed source.

This project(nicknamed STEP) is made up of a group of sub projects(AP classes), each that play their own role in aiding the process of exchanging data. EXPRESS is one of these.

IFC has been created on top of the framework of tools that the iso have provided and has achieved iso standard status.
